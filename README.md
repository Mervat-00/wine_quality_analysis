_investigating wine data set to show what charactaristics to consider when making wine _
-the data set has charactaristics like :
    -ph level 
    -residual sugar 
    -free and total sulfur dioxide
    -alcohol
    -density
    -quality
-the question is :what are the main charactaristics that keep the quality above 6? .
- i did my analysis using jupyter notebook as my framework .
- i used python modules like (pandas-numpy-matplotlib) .
- i visualized each variable to show its correlation with quality and the recommended range to keep the variable ratio in .
